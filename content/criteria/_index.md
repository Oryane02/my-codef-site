One does not just wake up and decide to be an Haute Couture Maison. It takes a lot of pre-requisites for this. 

Today, the _**Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture**_ selects the memebers of this style.

 > "To qualify as an official Haute Couture house:
 - members must design made-to-order clothes 
 - for private clients, 
 - with more than one fitting, 
 - using an atelier (workshop) 
 - that employs at least fifteen fulltime staff. 
 - They must also have twenty fulltime technical workers in one of their workshops."
