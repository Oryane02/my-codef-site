# Finally...
# An Explanation:

__Haute Couture__ = "High Dressmaking"

Haute Couture garments are created as one-off pieces for a specific client.

Funnily enough, _Charles Frederick Worth_, an Englishman from the 19th Century, is considered as the father of Haute Couture.

Every year, Haute Couture houses must present bi-annual collections for the seasons (January-FW and July-SS) to the public featuring no less than 50 original designs.

__Extra Facts__

- Haute Couture is government regulated
- "Ateliers" are the basis of couture
  - Even though most areas of the fashion industry are mechanised, the couture industry is purely made by hand
  - The "_petites mains_" work on garments in each atelier
  - A "_premiere_" supervises the petites mains and takes charge of the client fittings
    - It is Parisian law for the houses to provide client fittings
    - e.g., Dior requires three fittings (min.) for each garment!
- Clients are the main attendees of fashion shows
- Chanel is the biggest couture house
  - While Dior has two ateliers, Chanel reportedly has four
    - Two for tailoring, two for soft fabrics
