# About Me

My name is Oryane and, as "une Parisienne", I have grown up around the French arts and fashion culture. Anyone who knows me sees my committment to fashion. 

As a child, most of my gifts would be centred around fashion, styling and designing, thus, I grew up wanting to be a fashion design - more specifically for Haute Couture.


__What is Haute Couture though?__

This website is intended to explain the main parts of Haute Couture to the general public.

A lot of the 'high arts' are seen as inaccessible to the average person - this website aims to change that.
